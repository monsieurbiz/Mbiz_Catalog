# Mbiz_Catalog

This modules fix some bugs. Specialy about the custom layout settings in CMS Pages
and Category pages.

It also adds a helper `mbiz_catalog/layer` which provides some methods to be more effective
in the layers "view".

A new handle is available on category pages: `CATEGORY_LEVEL_X` where `X` is the level of the current category.
As an example, a standard category after the Website's root category is level 1. So it will add the handle `CATEGORY_LEVEL_2`.
